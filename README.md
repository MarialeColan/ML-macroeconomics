# ML-Macroeconomics: Inflation Forecasting in Peru ðŸ“ˆ
This repository is the culmination of our exploration into the dynamic realm of inflation forecasting in Peru as part of the module ML for macroeconomics of the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Methods in Social Sciences (QLAB).

### Title: "Inflation Forecasting in Peru: Benchmark vs. Machine Learning Models"
_Developed with Python_

### The Dueling Forces
1. BENCHMARK: Random Walk (RW) & Structural VAR
2. MACHINE LEARNING: Elastic Net (EN) & Random Forest (RF

### Conclusions
Machine learning methods outperformed a random walk or structural VAR in predicting inflation in Peru.
